## Introduction

Battleship Game is a C project where players engage in a thrilling naval battle. Players take turns targeting their opponent's ships on a 10x10 grid, using strategic moves like radar sweeps, smoke screens, and torpedo strikes. The goal? Sink all your opponentâ€™s ships before they sink yours. The game also features bot opponents with three difficulty levels for added challenge.
